# This is CSF Story with arbitrary MDX

[Re: CSF Stories with arbitrary MDX](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook/blob/next/addons/docs/docs/recipes.md#csf-stories-with-arbitrary-mdx)

You can't see Source of non-story content inside a Canvas block

<Canvas><div>Test Canvas</div></Canvas>

However, Story source is still available

<Canvas><Story id={"example-button--primary"}/></Canvas>

> This issue doesn't shows up in stories.mdx docs
